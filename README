A simple proxy server with the following characteristics:
 - HTTP only.
 - No keep-alive
 - Opens a new connection to the target server every time a client
   connection requests for it.
 - No caching.
 - Supports UTF-8 URLs (not tested)
 - Supports GET, POST and all other methods.
 - Supports HTTP video streaming, for e.g., youtube.
 - Supports logging of HTTP traffic from both client and server side.
 - Supports reading of chunked transfer encoding. 
   In the log files, even though the Transfer-encoding might specify
   "chunked", the data logged has already been decoded.

Feel free to modify the code for your own use. 
But please acknowledge the original author. Thanks!

Building
=========
Simply compile ProxyServer.java

Run
=========
Command: java ProxyServer <listen-port>

Log files will be created as proxy.<thread-id>.<client/serv>.log
For e.g., proxy.0.client.log stores all traffic received from the client.

The headers shown in the log files are in unmodified form, and might not
be the exact headers sent to the client/server.
